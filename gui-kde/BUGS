- default size of start dialog is too small
- Sometimes Esc key does not properly close diplo dialog
- ensure that observer cannot control the game
- connect dialog does not display players of local server
- connect dialog stops scanning servers
- start dialog: cannot start as an observer
- start dialog: starts as an observer
- ensure that it's possible to start new game even if there's a game ongoing
- helpdialog: initial show() does not select the first help item
- worklists: it's possible to have two lists with the same name
